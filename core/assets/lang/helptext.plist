			<key>A. Welcome</key>
			<string>Welcome to splash X6! 

Your adventure in this world is just beginning.
As you play, you&apos;ll learn to produce and control an army of units to use at your disposal.

Use them to defend, attack and explore as you build your civilisation and research.</string>
			<key>B. Getting started</key>
			<string>Your game starts with a single settler.

This unit has the power to create home to life in your civilisation.

Since he is your only unit at the start, he is selected by default. This allows you to start using him right away.

Press &apos;space&apos; to start selecting a destination, and &apos;space&apos; again to lock in that destination.

Press &apos;e&apos; to end your turn, and a few turns later the unit will arive.

Pressing &apos;x&apos; will open up more controls for the unit. Change his action from &apos;travel&apos; to &apos;settle&apos;.

Now, when you end your turn once more he will create a new city!

You&apos;ll note that by doing so, that settler is now spent, and despawns. Worry not, as your new found settlement can help!

Under the warroom menu, select &apos;settlements&apos; to open the settlements window. This window gives you access and control over your settlements, and thier production.

On the left, select a settler, and click &apos;add&apos; to add him to the production queue. The window will tell you exactly how many turns it will take in order to produce him.

A few turns later, you&apos;ll see a new settler spawn at your settlement!

In order to use him, you&apos;ll need to select him. You can do so by opening the &apos;units&apos; window, found in the &apos;warroom&apos; menu, and selecting the unit.</string>

			<key>D. Movement</key>
			<string>Your units will move and explore as you command.

To move a unit:
    - Start selecting a destination (see below)
    - Move cursor to a desired destination
    - The pathfinding line will indicate the path the unit will take to the desired location.
    - A red pathfinding line indicates inability to travel to destination.
    - Finalise destination selection (see below)

There are two ways to enter destination selection.

The warroom allows you to use your mouse cursor to direct your units, entering and finalising with a right-click. 

Alternatively, you may more quickly access this same eature by pressing &apos;space&apos; in the main game view by pressing space and moving the camera&apos;s reticle to point.

A unit may fail to pathfind to a destination under conditions such as water or high terrain blocking it&apos;s path.
Different units have different travel restrictions.</string>
			<key>E. Menu Bar</key>
			<string>The menu bar, located at the top of the screen, provides access to all the tools and windows you will need to play the game.

Each of the items on the menu may act as a button, a menu, or both.

Menus are indicated by the handle in the lower right of the button. Explore thier options by clicking and holding down the mouse on a button to open the drop-down menu, and dragging the curser over the options that appear before letting go.

Click an option in the menu or the menu button again to hide the drop-down.</string>

Certain units will have some actions that others do not, primarily at present the settler who can settle new city.

Units may also be disbanded from here, but note that the window controlling a unit does not close after the unit no longer exists.</string>
