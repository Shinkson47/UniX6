# dontClose

[jvm]\
open fun [dontClose](dont-close.md)()

Indicates that this window should not close, but instead just hide when the user clicks 'x'. 

 Useful for the functionality of the in-game menu system, where windows are toggled in visibility, and not disposed and re-created every time the user wants to see them.
