# State Machine Scripture

This sub project contains an external pre-compile language format and compiler written in ANTLR 4. Simply formatted scripts compile through the `SSVM` compuler to java using the `Javapoet` library.

The compiled output is compatable with X6's custom state machine AI implementation.
